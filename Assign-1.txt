# 1. Python based lambda function to export all cloud watch alerts from specific AWS account on 1st of every month

AS per my understanding we want to export/copy all the cloudwatch alerts from one specific AWS account to other.
This task require cross-account sharing of the cloudwatch alerts to different AWS account based on account number.
To do it i can only see the manual way to go to the cloudwatch setting & enabled the cross-acoount data-sharing.
I'm unable to find any boto3 cloudwatch apis to achieve it.
I'm putting the link of AWS docs for how to do it.
